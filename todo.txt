When a user logs in for the first time, the app should ask him to agree on some Google services (see below) and we should store the users in our local db and assign them a default role of w_user and an active flag set top false. Only w_users have access to the application. A w_admin user should be able to activate the newly registered users.
After saving a call registration (create or update), the user should be presented with the possibility to create a message that should be sent to a selection of active w_users (including the current user). Sending the message can be done by mail, by adding a calendar event and/or by adding a todo item to the addressee's tasks list. The same message is sent to the current user's email address and added to that message is the list of users who have received the message and the way they've received it.
So, when they register, users should accept that others have access to their tasks list and calendar (is that possible?)
The message object will be composed of a title, a short description, a link to a registration, a due date and a status or tag. I don't think it's necessary to store these messages in the DB
